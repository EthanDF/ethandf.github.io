Hold the phone... then give that phone to me.

Yesterday, I was called arrogant. In the past, I've been called that, tenacious, and worse. I'm not sure I care about being called names for having high expectations of my colleagues. In my past life as a corporate employee, getting things done meant being demanding but never being the one to drop the ball. I just wish I found that as often in my current worklife.

I'm going to work harder - get more done - and try to show by example what I think professionalism looks like. That includes not subtweeting. But, man, this frustration has to go somewhere.

To help with the nerves, here's one of the latest songs from Steven Universe. That show can sooth the soul.

Best of luck out there - I'll return to the regularly scheduled metadata learning soon.
