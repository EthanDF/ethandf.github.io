This is the first post on this page. I'm planning on using this blog to read things about metadata and share my notes on those documents. It might be painfully honest about what I know and what I don't. I want to be an expert on metadata in libraries but I'm not. Not yet!

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
