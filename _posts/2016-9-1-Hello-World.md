title: Welcome to Reading with Ethan

This is the first post on this page. I'm planning on using this blog to read things about metadata and share my notes on those documents. It might be painfully honest about what I know and what I don't. I want to be an expert on metadata in libraries but I'm not. Not yet!

A few other notes - this blog was made with Jekyll. If you want to make your own - follow the instructions on [this page by Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)

If you'd like to contact me, the best way is on twitter: @ethandf
